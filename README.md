# KMNIST_MachineLearning

This was the final project for my introductorty data science class at UC Irvine. In the project, I use [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) to explore different machine learning methods in an effort to classify the characters in the [KMNIST dataset](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist). I have made it very easy to follow along with the code in this project in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) if you should wish to do so.
