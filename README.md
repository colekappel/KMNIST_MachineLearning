# KMNIST_MachineLearning

This was the final project for my introductorty data science class at UC Irvine. In the project, I use google colab to explore different machine learning methods in an effort to classify the characters in the KMNIST dataset. I have made it very easy to follow along with the code in this project in google colab if you should wish to do so.
